        <h2>The Nigerian Tomato Stew</h2>

        <h4>About Tomato Stew</h4>
        <p>Rice is unarguably a staple food in Nigeria. The average Nigerian eats a rice meal at least once a week.
            In Nigeria, rice can be prepared and served in a variety of ways. One of such varieties is rice and tomato stew.
            A lot of Nigerian kids grew up enjoying this meal every Sunday.
        </p>
        <p>It is not quite clear, the exact origin of the tomato stew; and if it happens that it is not originally from Nigeria,
            we surely have made it our food in our own special way - the Nigerian tomato stew.
        </p>
        <p>One of the best things about the tomato stew is its versatility. It can be served with a range of accompaniments such as:
            white rice, boiled/fried yam, boiled/fried plantains, boiled/fried potatoes, Nigerian Jollof Rice, Spaghetti, Macaroni and so on.
